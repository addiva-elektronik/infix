# A single mstpd instance can manage multiple bridges, which are
# dynamically added/removed by the kernel via the /sbin/bridge-stp
# usermode helper. We use a manual service so that confd can
# enable/disable it without an initctl barrier, since it needs to
# already be running when a bridge interface with spanning tree
# enabled is created.
