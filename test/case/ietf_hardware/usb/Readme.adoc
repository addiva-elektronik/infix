=== USB configuration
==== Description
This tests if the configuration is consistent with hardware state,
and if the USB ports are _locked_ (forbidden for use) and _unlocked_
(Ready for use) when they should. Also tests if this is the case during
reboot. This does not the test actual use of the USB port, it just checks
that the configured state is consistent with the hardware state.

If this pass you can be certain of that the configuration of the USB
port is handled correctly.
