=== Bridge STP Basic
==== Description
Verify that a fully connected mesh of 4 DUTs is pruned to a spanning
tree.

Since the mesh contains 3 redundant paths, can infer that a spanning
tree has been created if all host interfaces can reach each other
while exactly three links are in the blocking state.

==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to target DUT
. Configure a bridge with spanning tree eneabled on dut a, b, c, and d
. Add an IP address to each host interface in the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet
. Verify that exactly three links are blocking
. Verify that host:a can reach host:{b,c,d}
