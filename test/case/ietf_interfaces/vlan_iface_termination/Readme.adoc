=== VLAN Interface Termination
==== Description
Verify that VLANs stacked on top of an interfaces that are also
attached to a VLAN filtering bridge are always locally terminated.

|        dut        |
|                   |
|  a.10  br0  b.10  |
|     \ /   \ /     |
'------a-----b------'
       |     |
       |     |
.------a-----b------.
|                   |
|       host        |
|                   |
'-------------------'

In this setup, even though VLAN 10 is allowed to ingress and egress on
both `a` and `b`, _bridging_ of packets from one to the other must
_not_ be allowed.

==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to dut
. Configure bridge and VLAN interfaces on dut
. Configure IP addresses and VLAN interfaces on host
. Verify that host:a reaches host:b with untagged packets
. Verify that traffic on VLAN 10 from host:a does not reach host:b
. Verify that host:a can reach dut on VLAN 10
. Verify that host:b can reach dut on VLAN 10
