=== Verify that all interface types can be created
==== Description
This test verifies that all interface types can be created and also
checks the configuration when applied sequentially. This method takes
slightly longer than sending the entire configuration at once.

==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to target DUT
. Configure an empty bridge br-0
. Configure bridge br-X and associated interfaces
. Configure VETH pair
. Configure bridge br-D and associated interfaces
. Configure br-Q and associated interfaces
. Verify interface 'lo' is of type loopback
. Verify interfaces 'ethX' and 'ethQ' are of type 'ethernet' (or etherlike if running Qemu)
. Verify interfaces 'br-0', 'br-X', 'br-D' and 'br-Q' are of type 'bridge'
. Verify interfaces 'veth0a' and 'veth0b' are of type 'veth'
. Verify interfaces 'veth0a.20', 'ethQ.10', 'ethX.30', 'ethQ.10' and 'br-Q.40' are of type 'vlan'
