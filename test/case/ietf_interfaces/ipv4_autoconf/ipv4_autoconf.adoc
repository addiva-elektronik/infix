==== Description
Verifies that link-local (IPv4LL/ZeroConf) address assignment work as
expected.  Checks random address, the request-address setting, and
address removal on autoconf disable.

==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to target DUT
. Configure interface target:data with IPv4 ZeroConf IP
. Verify link-local address exist on target:data
. Configure target:data with a specific IPv4 ZeroConf IP
. Verify target:data has link-local address 169.254.42.42
. Remove IPv4 link-local addresses from target:data
. Verify link-local addresses has been removed from target:data
