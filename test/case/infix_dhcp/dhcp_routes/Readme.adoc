=== DHCP option 121 vs option 3
==== Description
Verify DHCP option 121 (static routes) is used over option 3 and that the
routes exist in the operational datastore.

Installing unrelated routes from a DHCP server should not affect already
existing routes.  To verify this a canary route is set up in the client
before initiating DHCP.  This canary route does not need to be reachable
before a DHCP lease has been acquired.
