=== Container with bridge network
==== Description
Verify connectivity with a simple web server container from behind a
docker0 bridge.  As an added twist, this test also verifies content
mounts, i.e., custom index.html from running-config.

This also verifies port forwarding from container internal port to a
port accessed from the host.

==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to target DUT
. Create container 'web-docker0' from bundled OCI image
. Verify container 'web-docker0' has started
. Verify basic DUT connectivity, host:data can ping DUT 10.0.0.2
. Verify container 'web-docker0' is reachable on http://10.0.0.2:8080
